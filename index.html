        <p>
          The Universe constitutes our reality. Everything that we know of exists within the boundaries of the Universe. The Universe is a place of infinites and singularities, creation and destruction, matter and antimatter, life and inorganic materials. The Universe houses everything from the smallest electrons, quarks, and neutrinos to the most massive black holes, nebulae, and galaxies. And while we think that we understand the inner workings of the Universe fairly well, the truth is that it abounds in mysteries and unexplained phenomena. So what exactly do we know? Part of the answer lies within Astrophysics.

          Astrophysics is essentially the physics of celestial bodies, which include planets, stars, pulsars, and black holes. Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, and Thermodynamics all converge on massive scales in order to shape these bodies and determine their behavior. Astrophysics enables us to deduce information about distant galaxies and celestial bodies based on the metrics given by satellites and observatories. Without it, our understanding of the Universe, and in turn reality, would be limited to Earth. The overarching goals of this website are to teach anyone, including an idiot, the basics of astrophysics and give people a little more insight on the nature of our Universe.

      <p>
      Celestial bodies are naturally-occurring structures, objects, and particles in the Universe that lie beyond the reach of Earth’s atmosphere. The Sun, the Earth, the Moon, Jupiter, Alpha Centauri, the Milky Way, and the Virgo Supercluster are all examples of celestial bodies. Celestial bodies encompass virtually all of the matter within our Universe, with the notable exception of free protons, electrons, photons and light atoms scattered in the expanses of the cosmos. Besides gravitational waves, celestial bodies are the only the only objects in space-time that we can detect via electromagnetic radiation. Many celestial bodies are geologically, chemically, or physically active, and their activity constitutes one of many factors that contribute to the continually changing structure of our Universe. Among the most common celestial bodies in the observable universe are stars, planets, globular clusters, and nebulae. However, countless galaxies, neutron stars, black holes, pulsars, and galactic clusters abound within the boundaries of the Universe.

      <h4><strong>Types of Celestial Bodies</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural satellites: Massive objects that are in orbit around a star or another natural satellite or have the capacity to enter an orbit around those types of celestial bodies. Natural satellites are typically composed of gaseous, solid, and liquid substances including rock, water, methane, and oxygen.</li>
        <li>Stars: Vast gaseous objects massive and dense enough in order to perform nuclear fission and emit electromagnetic radiation. During the early stages of a star’s life, energy is produced via the fission of hydrogen atoms into helium, but near the end it will resort to heavier atoms like Lithium.</li>
        <li>Neutron Stars: An extremely dense, compact object composed primarily of tightly-packed neutrons that spins at a rapid rate (as quick as 43,000 rpm).</li>
        <li>Pulsars: A magnetized, rotating neutron star or white dwarf that emits electromagnetic radiation in “pulses” based on its spin rate.</li>
        <li>Black Holes: An infinitely dense singularity with a gravitational field so strong that no matter or radiation can escape once it has entered the event horizon.</li>
        <li>Nebulae: </li>
        <li>Galaxies: </li>
        <li>Clusters: </li>
